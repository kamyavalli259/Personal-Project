# Moon Phase Calendar

## Project Overview

This is a simple web application that displays a calendar for a selected month and year. Users can click on any day to see the moon phase for that date, along with a descriptive summary and a corresponding moon emoji.

The project uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to generate the calendar dynamically and calculate the moon phase based on the selected date â€” no external APIs are needed.

## Moon Phase Calculation

The moon phase is computed based on the selected date by comparing it to known lunar cycle information and the moon's age in days. The calculation divides the lunar cycle into eight phases, each corresponding to a specific emoji and description.
