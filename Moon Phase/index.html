  The Moon goes through 8 phases in its roughly 29.5-day cycle:<br><br>
  <div id="moonSummary">

    <strong id="1">New Moon (🌑):</strong> The Moon is invisible because its illuminated side faces the Sun and the dark side faces Earth. It rises and sets with the Sun and is up during the day.<br><br>

    <strong>Waxing Crescent (🌒):</strong> A silver sliver visible as the Moon’s illuminated portion starts to grow. The Moon rises a little later each day.<br><br>

    <strong>First Quarter (🌓):</strong> Half of the Moon’s illuminated side is visible. It rises around noon and is high in the evening sky.<br><br>

    <strong>Waxing Gibbous (🌔):</strong> Most of the Moon’s day side is visible and brightening.<br><br>

    <strong>Full Moon (🌕):</strong> The entire day side is visible, opposite the Sun. It rises at sunset and sets at sunrise.<br><br>

    <strong>Waning Gibbous (🌖):</strong> The visible illuminated part shrinks as the Moon moves back toward the Sun.<br><br>

    <strong>Last Quarter (🌗):</strong> Half of the illuminated side is visible again, but shrinking. It rises around midnight and sets at noon.<br><br>

    <strong>Waning Crescent (🌘):</strong> A thin curve is visible before the Moon returns to New Moon phase.<br><br>
